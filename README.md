# Real-Time-Facial-Detection-Using-Haar-Cascade

-----------------------------------------------

## Introduction
This project uses Haar Cascades for object detection. Haar Cascades are machine learning object detection algorithms. They use Haar features to determine the likelihood of a certain point being part of an object. In this case that object is a human face.

      ## What is a Haar Cascade? 
      Haar Cascades make use of a kind of filter to perform feature extraction from the given image. These filters inspect only one portion of the image at a time. The intensity of the pixels in the white portion         and in the black portion is added. The result of subtraction of these two summations is the feature extracted value[^2^][3].

Haar cascade combines multiple Haar features in a hierarchy to build a classifier. Instead of analyzing the entire image with each Haar feature, cascades break down the detection process into stages, each consisting of a set of features[^3^][2].
